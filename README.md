Code for my personal website (https://meghanmcclain.com)

My personal website includes HTML and CSS code. 
It has the index HTML page that has a corresponding CSS file (this index page has 3 sections: Home, About, & Contact)
On the index page, there's a Travel tab that links to a separate HTML page, which has a corresponding CSS file. 
The Travel tab displays pictures of books that I've read. Each book picture can be clicked on which takes you to a separate HTML page.
Eventually, each book picture will be able to take you to a separate HTML that will display my highlights for each book.
